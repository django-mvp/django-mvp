# Specification Quality Checklist: Form View Base Classes

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Dependencies on spec 007 (Object Page Foundation) and spec 008 (Safe Post-Submit Redirect) are documented in Assumptions.
- Concrete view classes (MVPFormView, MVPCreateView, etc.) are explicitly out of scope; this spec covers only the shared base layer.
- The delete view's use of MVPModelFormBase is acknowledged as an existing architectural decision and not contested by this spec.
